      <h2>Incision Assist App</h2>
      <h4>UX/UI Design | 2021</h4>
      <div class="pf-p">
        <p>
          I was responsible for designing the MVP for Incision Assist, a mobile app to improve team performance in the operating room (OR).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My role as the UX designer in this project was creating wireframes, UI designs and interactive prototypes based on previous data
          gathered in the discovery phase through different methods, such as personas, user journey, mind maps, and user stories. I also had
          the opportunity to join the first user testing session at a hospital in the Netherlands.

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <div class="pf-p">
          <blockquote>
            How can we help scrub nurses and anesthetists to prepare for surgery, learn and memorize surgeons-specific preferences for each
            procedure in their hospital?
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="pf-p">
          <p>
            Usually, hospitals have a large amount of procedures and protocols that can be only found in some specific hard drives and they
            can be quickly outdated. Furthermore, not everyone can access this information and it is also common to have different printed
            protocols, making it difficult to find the most up-to-date version for each procedure/surgeon.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Users can easily feel frustrated at having to remember all this information (surgeons preferences, required materials,
            patient-specific instructions, etc), especially in difficult or stressful situations, which can happen all too often in a
            hospital environment. All these factors together can even lead to errors or complications in surgical procedures.

      <div class="pf-p">
        <p>
          The Incision Assist app provides all important information to prepare users for surgery, whenever is needed. It is possible to
          search for a protocol and filter it by surgeon to see their preferences. Besides protocols, users can also search for materials or
          surgeons and save anything to quick access from the Favorites page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Scrub nurses can also check all room setup and patient preparation by opening the interactive 3D room. It is possible to see all
          necessary devices, patient and team positioning for each protocol.

          After creating the first high fidelity prototype, I had the opportunity to join the team in the first user testing session, at one
          of the hospitals that are our partners, in the Netherlands. It was a great experience and there were really nice insights about
          the app. The user testing showed that with only small changes we would be able to make good improvements in the overall user
          experience. As a result, new user stories were created and I worked for 2 years more in this product. As someone once told me: a
          mobile app is never “done”! There are always things to be improved.

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <div class="pf-p">
        <p>
          Beyond a companion app, Incision Assist aims to be also a learning platform. Users will be able to learn more not only about
          medical procedures, but also about devices and problem solving. I've worked on improvements and new features to attend all users'
          needs and add value to the product. I'm creating different posts here on my website for describing some of these projects. I'm
          still updating the content, so stay tuned!
